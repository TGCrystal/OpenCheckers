# OpenCheckers

This repository is currently just a demo for licensing.
To run a business using this, there would be a site that runs the code and allows playing games against the computer or other players. Certain features like analysis boards would require a paid subscribtion, however if someone were to download, build, and run the code they could access those features themselves for free.
By using the MIT license, is very open and would make it easy for people to modify to add more games or make their own modifications.
